## Project 1 
# [Soccer Player recognition using TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API](https://github.com/RohanLone/Tensorflow_Object_Detection_with_Tensorflow_2.0) 
* Created a model that detects players in frame.
* Created custom dataset and labelled using LabelImg
* Used Google Colab (for model training), Google Drive (for storage). 
* ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu pretrained model used to implement transfer learning.

## Project 2 
# [Vehicle Number Plate Detection](https://github.com/RohanLone/Number-Plate-Detection-App) 
For this example project I built a number plate detector to identify number plate from frame. This could be useful for Motorway Road Tolling, vehicle theft prevention and parking management. They could take a picture or real time video of a vehicle and an app could serve them number plate. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

This project strictly built on OpenCV. Created an application using Streamlit library.

## Project 3 
# [Face Verification](https://github.com/RohanLone/FaceVerification) 
* Built a deep learning model from scratch that verifies face.
* Used Tensorflow library to build model, This model learn information about object categories from one, or only a few, training samples/images.
* This model requires only one image of a person which can be used for face verification `(One Shot Learning)`.
* It can be used for image based attendance capturing system.

## Project 4 
# [Word Emebedding](https://github.com/RohanLone/word_embedding) 
Word embedding is a concept used in `natural language processing` to describe the representation of words for text processing, which is usually in the form of a real-valued vector that embeds the meaning of the word and determines that words that are near in the vector space will have similar meanings.
* Built a Keras model on IMDB Review Dataset for finding the relationship between words.
* Used Embedding projector to visualize the data.

## Project 5 
# [Face Mask Detection](https://github.com/RohanLone/Face_mask_detection) 
* Created a model that detects human faces with mask and without mask from images.
* 50 Images are used for model building and labelled using LabelImg
* Used Google Colab (for model training), Google Drive (for storage). 
* Achieved 0.878 and 0.883 Average Precision and recall respectively.
* ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu pretrained model used to implement transfer learning.

## Project 6
# Plant Leaf & Disease Recognition
In recent years, dramatic changes in climate and the lack of crop immunity have led to a significant increase in crop disease growth.
This project suggests improving the use technology and using the most efficient Convolution Neural Network model to work with maximum accuracy and minimal resource consumption as a detection system. A CNN based model trained with images of healthy and unhealthy plant leaves using public datasets is proposed in this study. 

The result of this project is supposed to be of huge advantage to farmers as smart phone image processing would assist them simply by taking a photo of the plant leaf and performing the test on their smart phone to examine the quality of their crops on land.

* Built CNN model using Tensorflow that detects plant and it's disease
* Dataset contains 80K+ images of healthy and diseased crop leaf.
* Implemented transfer learning.
* Built an web application for user interface

## Project  7
# [Word Cloud](https://github.com/RohanLone/wordcloud) 
Word cloud is an image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.

Word clouds are a simple and cost-effective way to visualise text data.

* Created interactive web application using open source Python library - `Streamlit`

## Project  7
# [Object Detection using OpenCV](https://github.com/RohanLone/object_detection_opencv) 
For this example project created an `HSV` mask using opencv and python for identifying object purely by it's color
The trackbar can be used for change the color for detection of object in frame.

**Following output is for black color object**
