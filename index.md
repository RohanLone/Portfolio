# Portfolio

Listed below are some of the projects that I have done in my own time.

## Project 1 
# [Water Quality Analysis & Data Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanlone4/water-quality-analysis-and-ensemble-modeling) 
Water Quality Analysis & Data Modeling is a project that focuses on assessing water quality and developing a predictive model for determining its suitability for human consumption. To assess whether a water sample is fit for human consumption, I developed a predictive model using an ensemble learning technique.

Here are the steps I took:

1. `Data preprocessing:` I cleaned the data by removing any null values and replacing them with the mean of the corresponding column.
2. `Data visualization:` I used the Seaborn library to visualize the data and identify any potential trends or patterns.
3. `Data modeling:` I trained a variety of machine learning models, including random forest, gradient boosting, AdaBoost, and LightGBM.
4. `Model evaluation:` I evaluated the performance of the models using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. `Hyperparameter tuning:` I tuned the hyperparameters of the random forest and LightGBM models to improve their accuracy.

The final model achieved an accuracy of 87%. This means that the model was able to correctly predict whether a water sample was fit for human consumption with a 87% accuracy. This model can be used to monitor water quality and identify potential problems. It can also be used to educate the public about the importance of water quality.

Here are some of the challenges I faced:
1. The data was noisy and imbalanced.
2. The models were computationally expensive to train and deploy.

Despite these challenges, I was able to develop a predictive model that can be used to assess water quality. This model has the potential to improve public health and protect the environment.

## Project 2 
# [Disaster Tweets: NLP with Tensorflow](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanlone4/disaster-tweets-nlp-with-tensorflow)
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

Predicting which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.  

* Built a Keras model on Kaggle's Competition data: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. 
* Performed EDA on data and visualized with word cloud.

## Project 3
# [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/RohanLone/Heart-Disease-Prediction) 
The data set contains continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is used to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.
The dataset consists of 303 individuals data. There are 14 columns in the dataset, which are described below.
    
   1. age
   2. sex
   3. cp, chest pain
   4. restbp, resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
   5. chol, serum cholesterol in mg/dl
   6. fbs, fasting blood sugar
   7. restecg, resting electrocardiographic results
   8. thalach, maximum heart rate achieved
   9. exang, exercise induced angina
   10. oldpeak, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
   11. slope, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
   12. ca, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
   13. thal, this is short of thalium heart scan.
   14. hd, diagnosis of heart disease, the predicted attribute

  *  Built an SVM classifier.
Before that dealt with the data, Prcoess like Data preprocessing, selection, identifying missing data, dealing with missing data is done.

## Project 4
# [Plant Leaf & Disease Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanlone4/plant-leaf-and-disease-recognition-using-fast-ai)
In recent years, dramatic changes in climate and the lack of crop immunity have led to a significant increase in crop disease growth.
This project suggests improving the use technology and using the most efficient Convolution Neural Network model to work with maximum accuracy and minimal resource consumption as a detection system. A CNN based model trained with images of healthy and unhealthy plant leaves using public datasets is proposed in this study. 

The result of this project is supposed to be of huge advantage to farmers as smart phone image processing would assist them simply by taking a photo of the plant leaf and performing the test on their smart phone to examine the quality of their crops on land.

* Built CNN model using Tensorflow that detects plant and it's disease
* Dataset contains 80K+ images of healthy and diseased crop leaf.
* Achieved Gold medal for notebook on kaggle
* Used different pre-trained model to implement transfer learning.
* Used different Data Augmentation techniques. 
* Achieved 99% accuracy.
* Built an web application for user interface

## Project  6

# [Word Emebedding](https://github.com/RohanLone/word_embedding) 
Word embedding is a concept used in `natural language processing` to describe the representation of words for text processing, which is usually in the form of a real-valued vector that embeds the meaning of the word and determines that words that are near in the vector space will have similar meanings.
* Built a Keras model on IMDB Review Dataset for finding the relationship between words.
* Used Embedding projector to visualize the data.

## Project  7
# [Word Cloud](https://github.com/RohanLone/wordcloud) 
Word cloud is an image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.

Word clouds are a simple and cost-effective way to visualise text data.

* Created interactive web application using open source Python library - `Streamlit`

## Project  11

# [Vehicle Number Plate Detection](https://github.com/RohanLone/Number-Plate-Detection-App) 
For this example project I built a number plate detector to identify number plate from frame. This could be useful for Motorway Road Tolling, vehicle theft prevention and parking management. They could take a picture or real time video of a vehicle and an app could serve them number plate. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

This project strictly built on OpenCV. Created an application using Streamlit library.
